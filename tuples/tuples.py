''' Tuples & Sets '''

'''
Fun Facts about Tuples
    -ordered and unchangeable (example, storing a username and password, storing an RGB value that must not change)
    -can't add or remove items
    -round brackets
    -faster than lists
    -used to store constants
    -used heterogeneous data structures (integers, floats, strings, etc) for example someone's age, gender and last name, (15, 'M', 'JONES')
    -heterogenous data structures save memory. why? lists need to over-allocate to account for new elements
    -readability
    -lets the programmer or other programmer know, this data collection should not be altered

# Count & Indexing

my_number_tuple = (1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10)

# Use the count Tuple method to count how many instances we have for 2, 3, 8, 9, 10



my_letter_tuple = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i')
# Use the index tuple method to return the position of letters b, d, f, h, and i


# Unpacking
user = ('Joe', 'Smith', 24)



# Loop through list of Tuples

weekdays = [("Monday", 1), ("Tuesday", 2), ("Wednesday", 3), ("Thursday", 4), ("Friday", 5), ("Saturday", 6), ("Sunday", 7)]


# Adding tuples
first_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
second_tuple = (4, 5, 6)
