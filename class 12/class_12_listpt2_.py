''' Exercise
You are given a list of integers. Write a Python program to create a new list that only includes the even numbers from the original list.
You can do this in one line with a list comprehension.
Example:
original_list = [34, 57, 81, 92, 2, 13]
new_list = [34, 92, 2]
'''

''' List comprehension for conditions'''
# With a For Loop
original_list = [34, 57, 81, 92, 2, 13]
new_list = []



# With list comprehension
original_list = [34, 57, 81, 92, 2, 13]



''' List comprehension with expressions'''

# Lets add 5 to every item in this list
numbers = [0, 2, 3, 8, 9, 11, 20]


# We can add two lists
first_list = [1, 2, 3]
second_list = [4, 5, 6]



# Multiply items from two lists
list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
list2 = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

Exercise

You work for a sales company and must generate a list of all customers who get a certain discount. The criteria for getting a discount is that they're over 60 years old and have made at least 5 purchases.
You have a list of customers over 60, and a list of customers who have made at least 5 purchases. Use a list comprehension to output a list of customers that fit both criteria for the discount. You can do this in one line of code.
Example:
over_60_years = ['Dominic', 'Linda', 'Simone', 'Swathi', 'Olaf']
over_5_purchases = ['Finn', 'Simone', 'Aaron', 'Dominic']
Output: ['Dominic', 'Simone']

over_60_years = ['Dominic', 'Linda', 'Simone', 'Swathi', 'Olaf']
over_5_purchases = ['Finn', 'Simone', 'Aaron', 'Dominic']
